<section class="intro">
    <h2>What is the Triple Planetary Crisis?</h2>
    <p>Our planet faces three interconnected challenges: <strong>Pollution, Climate Change, and Biodiversity Loss.</strong> 
        These issues threaten our environment, health, and future. The main cause? <strong>Human activities in search of energy</strong>, 
        such as mining for fossil fuels and operating nuclear power plants, leading to destruction and imbalance in nature.</p>

<section class="impact">
    <h2>Pollution: A Toxic Legacy</h2>
    <p>Pollution comes in many forms‚Äîair, water, soil, and plastic waste. Factories, vehicles, and improper waste disposal 
        introduce harmful chemicals into our surroundings.</p>
    <h3>Why does it happen?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heavy reliance on fossil fuels for energy and transportation</li>
        <li>Industrial waste dumping and improper waste management</li>
        <li>Excessive plastic use and a lack of recycling</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Impact:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Human Health:</strong> Causes respiratory diseases, heart problems, and water contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Burden:</strong> Pollution-related illnesses increase healthcare costs and reduce productivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Damage:</strong> Poisonous substances seep into the soil and water, harming wildlife and crops.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="climate">
    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
    <p>Greenhouse gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels, trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a warmer Earth and extreme weather patterns.</p>
    <h3>Why does it happen?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for energy</li>
        <li>Deforestation for land and industry</li>
        <li>Excessive use of cars, factories, and power plants</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What's the Result?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>More frequent storms, droughts, and heat waves</li>
        <li>Rising sea levels</li>
        <li>Disrupted agriculture and food supply</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="biodiversity">
    <h2>Biodiversity Loss: Vanishing Life</h2>
    <p>Nature thrives on balance, but human activities disrupt ecosystems, leading to the loss of species at alarming rates.</p>
    <h3>Why does it happen?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Land clearing for mining and energy production</li>
        <li>Pollution destroying habitats and food resources</li>
        <li>Overexploitation of natural resources</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Impact:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ecosystem Collapse:</strong> Loss of essential species weakens food chains.</li>
        <li><strong>Decline in Natural Resources:</strong> Fewer fish, plants, and animals available.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Climate Resilience:</strong> Harder for nature to adapt to climate changes.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="tips">
    <h2>Tips to Lessen the Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce Carbon Footprint: Use sustainable transport and energy-efficient appliances.</li>
        <li>Conserve Energy: Turn off unused electronics and lights.</li>
        <li>Protect Habitats: Join reforestation and conservation efforts.</li>
        <li>Support Sustainable Practices: Promote eco-friendly farming and fishing.</li>
        <li>Cut Plastic Usage: Choose reusable items over disposables.</li>
        <li>Dispose of Waste Properly: Recycle, compost, and safely discard hazardous waste.</li>
    </ul>
